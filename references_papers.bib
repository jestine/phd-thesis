title = {Elastic constants of single crystal Cr3Si and Cr-Cr3Si lamellar eutectic composites: a comparison of ultrasonic and nanoindentation measurements},
abstract = {The elastic constants of high quality single crystals of Cr3Si (cubic A 15 crystal structure) grown in an optical floating zone furnace were measured by ultrasonic methods and compared to the indentation modulus determined by nanoindentation techniques. The measured indentation moduli are within 5\% of the Vlassak-Nix predictions for elastically anisotropic materials provided a correction is made for the triangular cross-section of the Berkovich indenter. The indentation moduli of individual lamellae in a directionally solidified Cr-Cr3Si lamellar eutectic composite were also measured to examine how well the procedures apply to small microstructural features.

title = {Thermal expansion of the W5Si3 and T-2 phases of the W-Si-B system investigated by high-temperature X-ray diffraction},
abstract = {The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the W5Si3 and T-2 phases of the W-Si-B system were determined using high-temperature X-ray diffraction in the 298-1273 K temperature interval. Alloys with nominal compositions 62.5W37.5Si (at\%) and 5SW21Si21B (at\%) were prepared from high-purity materials through arc melting followed by heat treatment at 2073 K for 12 h under argon atmosphere. The highly different thermal expansion coefficients of W5Si3 along the a (5.0 x 10(-6) K-1) and c (16.3 x 10(-6) K-1) axes lead to a high thermal expansion anisotropy (alpha(c)/alpha(a) congruent to 3.3). On the other hand, the T-2-phase exhibits similar thermal expansion coefficients along the a (6.9 x 10(-6) K-1) and c (7.6 x 10(-6) K-1) axes, indicating a behavior close to isotropic (alpha(c)/alpha(a) congruent to 1.1).

title = {Eutectic colony formation: A phase-field study},
abstract = {Eutectic two-phase cells, also known as eutectic colonies, are commonly observed during the solidification of ternary alloys when the composition is close to a binary eutectic valley. In analogy with the solidification cells formed in dilute binary alloys, colony formation is triggered by a morphological instability of a macroscopically planar eutectic solidification front due to the rejection by both solid phases of a ternary impurity that diffuses in the liquid. Here we develop a phase-field model of a binary eutectic with a dilute ternary impurity. We investigate by dynamical simulations both the initial linear regime of this instability, and the subsequent highly nonlinear evolution of the interface that leads to fully developed two-phase cells with a spacing much larger than the lamellar spacing. We find a good overall agreement with our recent linear stability analysis [M. Plapp and A. Karma, Phys. Rev. E 60, 6865 (1999)], which predicts a destabilization of the front by long-wavelength modes that may be stationary or oscillatory. A fine comparison, however, reveals that the assumption commonly attributed to Cahn that lamellae grow perpendicular to the envelope of the solidification front is weakly violated in the phase-field simulations. We show that, even though weak, this violation has an important quantitative effect on the stability properties of the eutectic front. We also investigate the dynamics of fully developed colonies and find that the large-scale envelope of the composite eutectic front does not converge to a steady state, but exhibits cell elimination and tip-splitting events up to the largest times simulated.},

title = {Study of the role of Fe and Sn additions in the microstructure of Nb-24Ti-18Si-5Cr silicide based alloys},
abstract = {The role of Fe and Sn additions in the microstructures of the as cast and heat treated alloys Nb-24Ti-18Si-5Cr-5Fe (NV3) and Nb-24Ti-18Si-5Cr-5Fe-5Sn (NV5) were studied. The microstructure of the as cast alloy NV3 consisted of the (Nb,Ti)(ss), (Nb,Ti)(5)Si-3, (Nb,Ti)(3)Si and metastable Nb 3-1 suicides, FeNb4Si and a Ti rich oxide. The (Nb,Ti)(5)Si-3 exhibited severe cracking everywhere in the ingot. The microstructure of the heat treated alloy NV3 consisted of the (Nb,Ti), (Nb,Ti)(5)Si-3, FeNb4Si and metastable Nb 3-1 silicides, with the latter at the higher volume fraction. The addition of Fe in the alloy NV3 retarded the Nb3Si -> Nb-ss + alpha Nb5Si3 eutectoid transformation during solidification, and enhanced the sensitivity of (Nb,Ti)(3)Si formation on cooling rate. The phases present in the microstructure of the as cast alloy NV5 were the (Nb,Ti)(ss), (Nb,Ti)(3)Sn, (Nb,Ti)(5)Si-3, (Nb,Ti)(3)Si and metastable 3-1 silicides, FeNb4Si, Fe7Nb6 and a Ti rich oxide. The formation of the Fe7Nb6 intermetallic was sensitive to cooling rate. The microstructure of the heat treated alloy NV5 consisted of the (Nb,Ti)(3)Sn, metastable Nb 3-1 silicide, FeNb4Si, the Ti rich oxide and (Nb,Ti)(5)Si-3. It is concluded that in Nb-24Ti-18Si-based alloys the addition of 5 at.\% Fe enhances the stability of the (Nb,Ti)(3)Si and that the addition of 5 at.\% Fe and 5 at.\% Sn destabilises the (Nb,Ti)(ss).

title = {Oxidation resistant Ru containing Ni base single crystal superalloys},
abstract = {Oxidation resistant fourth and fifth generation Ni base superalloys were developed. The fourth generation superalloys TMS-138A were modified by increasing the content of Al and Cr and deceasing Mo. Designed alloys were cast as single crystal and examined in cyclic and isothermal exposures at 1100 degrees C and creep rupture test. Under high temperature/low stress condition, 0.5 wt-\% of Al addition was effective to improve the oxidation resistance but degrade creep property. Cr addition and Mo and W reduction were effective to improve the oxidation resistance and display creep property almost equal to the original TMS-138A. The fourth generation superalloy TMS-138 and fifth generation superalloy TMS-173 were also modified. By adding Cr and removing Mo and W, their oxidation resistances were dramatically improved. Thus it was found that it is possible to improve the oxidation resistance of Ru containing SC superalloys with keeping the high temperature strength by the increase in Cr and decrease in Mo and W.},

title = {A coupled thermodynamic/kinetic model for diffusional processes in superalloys},
abstract = {A coupled thermodynamic/kinetic model for diffusional processes in superalloys is described. Use is made of the generalised force-flux equations, and therefore an accurate knowledge of thermodynamical properties of the system is a prerequisite for the calculations. Calculations can be carried out in either the lattice-fixed (Kirkendall) or the mass-invariant (Matano) frame. In order to model transformations, e.g. involving the gamma and gamma' phases, the concept of an interface sub-system is introduced. The numerical accuracy and stability associated with the treatment of the moving boundary is shown to be comparable to more traditional analyses which incorporate the Murray-Landis transformation. The results from the simulations are compared with experimental information, which includes (i) concentration profiles, (ii) movement of inert markers and (iii) observations of porosity formation. Particular attention is paid to the simulation of Ni-Al-Cr interdiffusion in the f.c.c. phase, for which reliable thermodynamic and kinetic information is available. Similar comparisons have been made for precipitation reactions involving the gamma' phase, although the available information is very sparse. Observations made on a number of Ni-Ni-3(Al,Ti) couples can be simulated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Particular advantages of the method are (i) the interface between phases is treated in a novel way, which avoids numerical difficulties arising from the estimation of concentration gradients at phase boundaries, (ii) it can be readily extended to multicomponent systems, and (iii) the treatment of the Kirkendall drift of vacancies. It is clear that there is a great need for experimentation aimed at deducing kinetic data, e.g. diffusional mobilities, particularly for the gamma' phase. (C) 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

abstract = {V alloy ingots with Cr contents higher than 25 mass\% cannot be subjected to plastic working, and hence the alloys have not been fabricated for structural applications so far. In order to develop such high Cr, V-based alloys, advanced powder metallurgical processes utilizing mechanical alloying and HIP were applied and V-28Cr-23Y and V-52Cr-1.8Y (mass\%) alloys were successfully fabricated. The alloys were annealed at 1273-1673 K and subjected to TEM microstructural examinations and tensile tests at room temperature.The V-28Cr-23Y and V-52Cr-1.8Y alloys had fine grains ranging from 0.27 to 4.7 mu m and fine dispersoids of Y2O3, YN and Y. Both alloys, without plastic working after consolidation, exhibit superior mechanical properties; sufficient elongation and high strength. This work yielded the first success in the development of V-Cr alloys and the features of the alloys are discussed in terms of further enhancement of microstructural stability and tensile properties.

title = {Overview - Residual stress part 1 - Measurement techniques},
abstract = {Residual stress is that which remains in a body that is stationary and at equilibrium with its surroundings. It can be very detrimental to the performance of a material or the life of a component. Alternatively, beneficial residual stresses can be introduced deliberately, Residual stresses are more difficult to predict than the in-service stresses on which they superimpose, For this reason, it is important to have reliable methods for the measurement of these stresses and to understand the level of information they can provide. In this paper, which is the first part of a two part overview, the effect of residual stresses on fatigue lifetimes and structural integrity are first summarised, followed by the definition and measurement of residual stresses. Different types of stress are characterised according to the characteristic length scale over which they self-equilibrate. By comparing this length to the gauge volume of each technique, the capability of a range of techniques is assessed. In the second part of the overview, the different nature and origins of residual stress for various classes of material are examined.},

title = {Growth of oxide scales upon isothermal oxidation of CVD-FBR aluminide coated stainless steel},
abstract = {The performance of different alloys exposed at high temperature environments depends upon their mechanical resistance as well as their corrosion/oxidation properties. When the mechanical requirements are not critical, austenitic stainless steels may play a role in substituting the more expensive Ni and Co base alloys. However, at temperatures close to 950degreesC, the chromia scale usually grown to protect the alloy may be further oxidised into CrO3, which is a volatile oxide and thus, the naked material may undergo a catastrophic oxidation. Fe-Cr-Al alloys have been shown to be oxidation resistant at high temperatures. This relies on the formation of alumina scales to protect the alloy, having a chromium reservoir so as to reduce the aluminium amount needed to maintain the oxide scale. In this work, aluminide coatings were deposited by means of the CVD-FBR technique on AISI 304 substrates, at 525degreesC for 1.5 h. A subsequent heat treatment up to 900degreesC was applied to the coated specimens to enhance interdiffusion of the species, which led to substoichiometric NiAl phases. Uncoated as well as coated plus heat-treated specimens have been oxidised at 950degreesC, up to 200 h, under continuous and discontinuous isothermal conditions. The results indicate that aluminide coatings provide a much higher beneficial effect under continuous oxidation than in discontinuous tests, the latter undergoing breakaway oxidation. Growth morphologies and compositions will show an iron enrichment during the latter oxidation stages, which will be responsible for oxidation resistance failure in the discontinuous tests.

title = {An explicit formulation for multiscale modeling of bcc metals},
abstract = {Many materials for specialized applications exhibit a body-centered cubic structure; e.g., tantalum, vanadium, barium and chromium. In addition, the successful modeling of body-centered cubic (bcc) metals is a necessary step toward modeling of common structural materials such as iron. Implicit formulations for this class of materials exist [e.g., Stainier, L, Cuitino, A., Ortiz, M.. 2002. A micromechanical model of hardening, rate sensitivity, and thermal softening in bcc crystals. journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 50 (7), 1511-1545; Kuchnicki, S., Radovitzky, R., Cuitino, A., Strachan, A., Ortiz, M., 2007. A pressure-dependent multiscale model for bcc metals], but are impractical to resolve large-scale dynamic deformation processes. In this article, we describe a procedure analogous to Kuchnicki et al. [Kuchnicki, S.. Cuitino, A., Radovitzky, R., 2006. Efficient and robust constitutive integrators for single-crystal plasticity modeling. International journal of Plasticity 22 (10),1988-2011]. wherein we construct an explicit formulation for the multiscale physics models. This update is based on the model of Kuchnicki et al. (in preparation) using a power law representation for the plastic slip rates. The existing implicit form of the model provides qualitative matching with experiments at quasi-static strain rates. The model is recast in an explicit form and applied first to a high quasi-static strain rate to verify that the two forms of the model return similar predictions for similar input parameters. The explicit model is also applied to several high strain rates, showing that it captures characteristic features observed in experimental tests of high-rate deformations, such as the drop in stress immediately after yield that is present in split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments. This test provides qualitative evidence that the model is suitable for high-strain-rate applications. The utility of the model is further demonstrated by a one-dimensional simulation of a SHPB test. Finally, a test case modeling pressure impact of a Tantalum plate using 600,000 elements is shown. The simulations show that the explicit model is capable of recovering the salient features of the experiments while integrating the constitutive update in a robust manner. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The published thermodynamic descriptions for the Cr-Si and Hf-Si binary systems were directly used; the thermodynamic description for the Cr-Hf binary system was modified in the present study. The ternary interaction parameters were optimized using EPMA measurements on the solid-state phase equilibria at 1200 degrees C, DTA measurements for the Cr-63Hf-4Si alloy, and liquid-solid reaction information extracted from as-cast microstructures of the metal-rich Cr-Hf-Si alloys. Comparisons between the calculated results and the experimental measurements show that the new model developed in the present study can satisfactorily describe the metal-rich region of the Cr-Hf-Si ternary phase diagram.

title = {Tensile creep of Mo-Si-B alloys},
abstract = {Multiphase Mo-Si-B alloys containing a Mo solid solution matrix and brittle Mo3Si and Mo5SiB2 (T2) intermetallic phases are candidates for ultra-high-temperature applications. The elevated temperature uniaxial tensile response at a nominal strain rate of 10(-4) s(-1) and the tensile creep response at constant load between 1000 degrees C and 1300 degrees C of a (i) single phase solid solution (Mo-3.0Si-1.3B in at.\%), (ii) two-phase alloy containing similar to 35 vol.\% T2 phase (Mo-6Si-8B in at.\%) and (iii) three-phase alloy with similar to 50 vol.\% T2 + Mo3Si phases (Mo-8.6Si-8.7B in at.\%) were evaluated. The results confirm that Si in solid solution significantly enhances both the yield strength and the creep resistance of these materials. A Larson-Miller plot of the creep data showed improved creep resistance of the two- and three-phase alloys in comparison with Ni-based superalloys. The extent of Si dissolved in the solid solution phase varied in these three alloys and Si appeared to segregate to dislocations and grain boundaries. A stress exponent of similar to 5 for the solid solution alloy and similar to 7 at 1200 degrees C for the two multiphase alloys suggested dislocation climb to be the controlling mechanism. Grain boundary precipitation of the T2 phase during creep deformation was observed and the precipitation kinetics appear to be affected by the test temperature and applied stress.

abstract = {A novel family of bond coats designed to be in EQuilibrium with their nickel-base superalloy substrates has been developed. These coatings have hence been termed 'EQ coatings'. The first step taken for EQ coating development was to examine the gamma-gamma' tie-lines of several superalloys. In these superalloys, gamma and gamma' are in equilibrium with each other, and elemental activities are thus equal in these two phases. With equal activities. there will be no chemical potential differences between the two phases. and there is thus no driving force for diffusion. Applying gamma, gamma'. or a combination of both as bond coat candidates will ensure that no inter-diffusion zone (IDZ) will form. This is desirable, as IDZ causes gross local mechanical property degradation.In this paper. the gamma' volume fraction was varied from 0 to 100\% at 25\% intervals along the gamma-gamma' tie-line of a nickel-base single-crystal alloy, TMS-82+. Cyclic and isothermal oxidation tests were conducted at 1100 degrees C in ambient atmosphere. The resultant oxide structures, and the element concentration profiles from around the oxide/substrate interface, through the depletion zone. into the sound substrate. were analyzed by SEM/EDX.All samples started with the same element activities hence, at the onset of oxidation, all samples were expected to form the same oxide structure. However, experiments showed that the specimens formed vastly different oxide structures. and that gamma' had the best resistance against high temperature oxidation.},

All the alloys exhibited linear oxidation kinetics. The as-cast (Nb,Ti)(3)Si containing Nb-24Ti-18Si alloy suffered from catastrophic pest oxidation. The other alloys, in which the Nb5Si3 was present, did not pest. Al addition reduced the oxidation rate significantly. Higher oxidation rates and lower adherence of the oxide scale were observed with increase of Cr concentration and/or Ta addition in the Al-containing alloys. In the oxide scales, Si-containing and non-Si-containing oxides of the stoichiometry MO2 were present together with remnants of 5-3 silicide and/or Laves phase. The oxygen solubility in the latter two phases was not high and these phases did not oxidise easily compared to the (Nb,Ti)(ss). Below the oxide scale of the Nb-24Ti-18Si-5Al alloy a thick (similar to 100 mu m) internal oxidation zone was formed where the (Nb,Ti)(ss) contained up to 30 at.\% dissolved oxygen. In the Nb-24Ti-18Si-5Cr alloy this zone was thinner and leaner in oxygen. In the Cr- and Al-containing alloys the internal oxidation zone was almost eliminated and the diffusivity of oxygen through the (Nb,Ti)(ss) was reduced owing to the synergy of the Ti, Cr and Al additions, which was not affected by the addition of Ta to the alloy. The presence of Cr-rich C14 silicide Laves phase in the microstructure of some alloys was not beneficial regarding their oxidation at 800 degrees C. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The A15 compounds, though considered to have the simplest of the topologically closed packed structures, form a distinct class of intermetallics with a cubic structure and are adjacent phases to the refractory metal solid solutions. This report summarizes the evaluation of microstructures, mechanical properties and cyclic oxidation resistance of Nb3Al and Cr3Si and their ternary alloys, and to a limited extent binary V3Si. The mechanical properties of binary compounds, elastic modulus, ultimate strength and creep behavior, are compared with known data for other A15 compounds. Solubility limits, melting point suppression and enhancement in creep resistance of several ternary alloys based on Nb3Al and Cr3Si are summarized. The mechanical properties and microstructural observations are discussed from the perspective of developing high temperature structural materials based on A15 intermetallics.},

title = {High-temperature compression behavior of Mo-Si-B alloys},
abstract = {The compression behavior of a two-phase (Mo solid solution + T2) Mo-6. 1Si-7.913 (at.\%) alloy is examined as a function of strain rate in the 1000-1400 degreesC range and compared to that of commercially available powder-metallurgy-processed TZM (often referred to as MT104). A limited number of tests was also conducted on a three phase alloy with a composition of Mo-8.6Si8.713 (at.\%) that lies in the three phase field, Mo solid solution + T2 + Mo3Si. These compression studies confirmed that deformation in the temperature-strain rate space evaluated is matrix-controlled, yielding an activation energy of similar to415-445 kJ/mol. As a consequence, the response of the three-phase material overlaps that of the two-phase material. In all instances evaluated, the Mo-Si-B alloys exhibit superior flow stress relative to their TZM counterpart. Examination of the deformed microstructure illustrates that recovery and in some instances, recrystallization occurs in the Mo solid solution matrix whereas the T2 phase either cracks or deforms plastically depending on the temperature and strain rate used. Finite element analysis assuming an elastic-plastic matrix and an elastic second-phase illustrates strain localization in the matrix, the extent being more severe when the work-hardening rate in the matrix decreases (i.e., increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate), while the T2 particles are highly stressed. However, if plastic deformation is permitted in the T2 particles, strain distribution is homogenized substantially and the level of stress build up in the T2 particles diminishes by an order of magnitude. The interplay between matrix and T2 properties and their dependence on temperature and strain rate are used to explain the observed deformed microstructure. (C) 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

Utilizing electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), the approach relies on the non-uniform partitioning of alloying elements between primary alpha and regions containing secondary-alpha lamellae and residual beta matrix phase. The method was evaluated using samples of Ti-6Al-4V for which vanadium Partitions strongly to secondary alpha + beta regions. The technique thus provides a useful tool for quantifying the evolution of deformation texture in the primary alpha and transformation texture in secondary alpha formed via decomposition of the beta matrix following hot working or final heat treatment.

The concentration profiles so-obtained have been determined using an electron microprobe. Subsequently, values of the interdiffusion coefficients were determined using a modified form of the Boltzmann-Matano analysis, and these are presented.

abstract = {The phase equilibria in the Nb-rich portion of Nb-B system have been evaluated experimentally using metallographic analysis, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction. It showed that Nb-ss (solid solution) and NbB are the only two primary phases in the 0-40 at.\% B composition range, and the eutectic reaction L <-> Nb-ss + NbB exists, instead of the generally accepted reaction L <-> Nb-ss + Nb3B2, as indicated in the Nb-B phase diagram. The Nb3B2 phase, however, forms by the peritectoid reaction Nb-ss + NbB <-> Nb3B2. DTA tests were conducted on annealed Nb-14B, Nb-16B, Nb-18B and Nb-40B alloys, and temperature and heat of phase transition were determined. The eutectic reaction (L <-> Nb-ss + NbB) temperature was determined to be 2104 +/- 5 degrees C, and the heat of phase transition was estimated as 22-30 kJ/mol, depending on the method of calibration used. The thermal event associated with peritectoid reactions was not observed in DTA curves due to sluggish solid state transformation, but the thermal annealing experiments show that peritectoid temperature is above 1900 degrees C.

title = {PREDICTION OF PHASE SELECTION IN RAPID SOLIDIFICATION USING TIME-DEPENDENT NUCLEATION THEORY},
abstract = {Time dependent nucleation theory has been applied to calculate temperature vs incubation time curves of competing phases, the nucleation temperatures and the critical cooling rates required for the formation of primary phases in undercooled melts. The incubation time is controlled by melt undercooling and diffusivity in the melt especially at large undercoolings. Larger melt undercoolings are required for the suppression of intermetallic phases with increasing solute content. The predicted hierarchy of phase selection in Al-TM (TM = Cr, Ti) alloys is in agreement with experimental results. The calculated phase boundaries on nucleation maps of Al-TM alloys are in agreement with experimental results, especially when heterogeneous volume nucleation is considered. The fit to experiment of calculations where the diffusion coefficient in the melt is related to viscosity is improved by considering T(g) = 0.25 T0.},

The V5Si3 phase exhibits thermal expansion anisotropy equals to 1.3, with thermal expansion coefficients along the a and c-axis equal to 9.3 x 10(-6) K-1 and 11.7 x 10(-6) K-1, respectively. Similarly, the thermal expansion anisotropy value of the T-2-phase is 0.9 with thermal expansion coefficients equal to 8.8 x 10(-6) K-1 and 8.3 x 10(-6) K-1 along the, a and c-axis respectively.

title = {Microstructure and oxidation behaviour of chromium-molybdenum silicides},
abstract = {In the present study the results regarding a microstructural investigation carried out on mixed Cr-Mo silicide alloys are presented. A powder metallurgy route was adopted for the preparation of the specimens. The green compacts obtained from powder mixtures were hot-pressed at 1400 degrees C for several hours. Two batches were prepared, in one of which 15 vol.\% of Pt-6\%Rh fibres were introduced. The majority phases present in the materials are: Cr3Si and Cr5Si3 with molybdenum in solution. Scanning electron microscopy observations were carried out in order to better characterise the microstructure of the alloys. Isothermal oxidation treatments were conducted on metallographically polished alloy coupons. The treatments were carried out in air at temperatures ranging from 900 up to 1100 degrees C. The oxide scales were examined with X-ray diffractometry and electron microscopy to obtain information on the oxidation mechanisms. At 900 degrees C all the analysed samples revealed excellent oxidation resistance determined by the formation of a continuous protective Cr2O3 surface layer. At 1000 degrees C Cr2O3 is still the main oxide phase in the scale even though, particularly for the specimen without Pt fibres, it starts to be destabilised with the formation of the volatile CrO3 phase. At 1100 degrees C some cristobalite is also present in the oxide scale. The oxidation kinetics are largely dominated by the formation of CrO3. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

abstract = {Despite its significant effect on metal deformation, grain size is not usually considered when modelling the evolution of intergranular stresses. This paper presents an experimental in situ straining neutron diffraction study of deformation in two interstitial free steels with different grain sizes, one with 80 mu m and one with 350 mu m. These were compared against the predictions of crystal plasticity finite element modelling, which is scale insensitive. Only small differences in the evolution of both mean grain family elastic strains and peak width were detected. These were attributed to local texture effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In-situ refractory metal intermetallic composites(RMICs) based either on (Nb, Si) or (Mo, Si, B) are candidate materials for ultra-high temperature applications (> 1 400 degrees C). To provide a balance of mechanical and environmental properties, Nb-Si composites are typically alloyed with Ti and Cr, and Mo-Si-B composites are alloyed with Ti. Phase diagrams of Nb-Cr-Ti-Si and Mo-Si-B-Ti, as prerequisite knowledge for advanced materials design and processing development, are critically needed. The phase diagrams in the metal-rich regions of multicomponent Nb-Cr-Ti-Si and Mo-Si-B-Ti were rapidly established using the Calphad (Calculation of phase diagram) approach coupled with key experiments. The calculated isotherms, isopleths, and solidification paths were validated by experimental work. The important heterogeneous multiphase equilibria in both quaternary systems identified will offer engineers the opportunity to develop materials with a balance of properties for high-temperature applications.},

abstract = {Knowledge on the phase equilibria at the metal-rich region of Hf-Ti-Si was needed for the development of Nb-silicide based composites. A total of seven Hf-Ti-Si alloys with Si concentrations up to 37.5 at.\% were fabricated by directional solidification and annealed at 1350 degrees C. The microstructure of the annealed alloys was examined using scanning electron microscopy, electron probe rnicroanalysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The alpha(Hf,Ti,Si), alpha(Hf,Ti,Si), (HfTi)(5)Si-3, and Hf(Ti)(2)Si phases were identified in the metal-rich region of the Hf-Ti-Si system. The phase relationships between these phases are two three-phase equilibria: beta(Hf,Ti,Si) + (Hf,Ti)(5)Si-3 + Hf(Ti)(2)Si, and beta(Hf,Ti,Si) + alpha(Hf,Ti,Si) + Hf(Ti)(2)Si, and three two-phase equilibria beta(Hf,Ti,Si) + (Hf,Ti)(5)Si-3, beta(Hf,Ti,Si) + Hf(Ti)(2)Si, and alpha(Hf,Ti,Si) + Hf(Ti)(2)Si. The solubility of Ti in Hf(Ti)(2)Si was measured as 9.8 at.\%. The Si concentration in beta(Hf,Ti,Si) ranges from 0.8 to 3.3 at.\%, while that in a(Hf,Ti,Si) is about 2.6-2.7 at.\%.

abstract = {Pseudo-binary (Mo0.90Nb0.10)Si-2 and (Mo0.85Nb0.15)Si-2 containing duplex C11(b) and C40 phases were prepared in a slow solidification process using the floating zone method to obtain basic knowledge regarding control of their microstructure. In (Mo0.90Nb0.10)Si-2 a thick band-like C40 phase was formed along grain boundaries in the C11(b) matrix, while peculiar fine lamellar colonies composed of the C11(b) and C40 phases appeared in (Mo0.85Nb0.15)Si-2 accompanied by constituent large C11(b) and C40 grains. The orientation relationship between the two phases at the lamellar boundary was determined to be (0001)(C40)\\(110)(C11b) and [<11(2)over bar 0>](C40)\\[1(1) over bar 1](C11b). Although the atomic stacking sequence changed from threefold periodical layers on (0001) planes in the C40 phase to two-fold layers on (110) planes in the C11(b) phase at the lamellar boundary, the lattice mismatch at the interface was very small (within 3\%), resulting in good thermal stability of this microstructure and high strength at high temperatures. The phase transformation must proceed by the motion of all four 1/6[1(1) over bar 2]-type partial dislocations on two layers of every three (0001) layers in the C40 phase to avoid large lattice distortion.

abstract = {Mo-ss-based Mo-Si-B multiphase alloys possess improved fracture toughness Compared to its singlephase silicide counterparts (MoSi2, Mo5Si3 or Mo5SiB2) without sacrifying high temperature strength, but they degrade rapidly in an oxidizing environment at elevated temperature. In the present study, an MoSi2 coating was applied to protect the Mo-ss-based alloy from high temperature oxidation via pack cementation. A boron-modified MoSi2 coating was also produced in an attempt to enhance the oxidation resistance of MoSi2 coating via co-deposition of B and Si, or using a two-step process. Isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests on coated Mo-12Si-8B (at.\%) alloy were performed at 1100 degrees C and 1600 degrees C, respectively up to 200 h. The MoSi2 coating provides enough protection from oxidation in both static and cyclic conditions at 1100 degrees C, while at 1600 degrees C it degraded after 10 h by forming less protective T1 (Mo5Si3Bx) phase via interdiffusion between coating and substrate. The coating lifetime of MoSi2 was limited by the Si depletion due to diffusion into substrate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title = {Effects of composition on lamellar microstructures of near-eutectic Cr-Cr3Si alloys},
abstract = {A series of binary Cr Si alloys with silicon concentrations ranging from 13 to 24 at.\% were produced by arc melting and drop casting. These. compositions span the composition (15 at.\% Si) at which a eutectic reaction is reported in the phase diagram. The microstructure of the Cr-16.05 at.\% Si alloy is fully lamellar and devoid of any pro-eutectic phases suggesting that the best composition for obtaining fully lamellar structure is Cr-16.05 at.\% Si, rather than the eutectic composition (Cr-15 at.\% Si) indicated in the phase diagram. The alternating lamellae in the eutectic alloy consist of Cr (solid solution) and Cr3Si (intermetallic). Alloys that are chromium-rich relative to the 16.05 at.\% Si contain pro-eutectic chromium whereas those that are silicon-rich contain proeutectic Cr3Si. Directional solidification of drop-cast Cr-Cr3Si alloys with nominal compositions ranging from 15 to 16.6 at.\% Si was carried out using a high-temperature optical floating zone furnace. Uniform and well-aligned lamellar microstructures of Cr-Cr3Si were observed when the growth conditions and alloy composition were optimized. Fully lamellar microstructures were obtained after directional solidification only when the starting composition was slightly enriched in chromium (Cr-15.95 at.\% Si) relative to the composition of the fully lamellar drop cast alloy (Cr-16.05 at.\% Si). A possible reason for this discrepancy is chromium evaporation during directional solidification. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title = {Phase stability and structural defects in high-temperature Mo-Si-B alloys},
abstract = {For high-temperature application beyond the range of Ni-base superalloys, Mo-Si-B alloys with composition that yield the tertiary intermetallic, Mo5SiB2, T-2, phase as a key microstructure constituent, offer an attractive property balance of high-melting temperature, oxidation resistance, and useful high-temperature mechanical properties. With the T-2 tertiary phase as the focal point of the microstructure designs, the fundamental basis of the alloying behavior in T-2 including the mutual solid solution with a wide range of transition metals has been established in terms of the governing geometric and electronic factors. For non-stoichiometric compositions, constitutional defects such as vacancies for Mo-rich compositions and anti-site defects for Mo-lean compositions control the homogeneity range. Moreover, the aggregation of constitutional vacancies has been discovered to play a key role in the development of dislocation and precipitation reactions in the T-2 phase that directly impact high-temperature structural performance. The characteristically sluggish diffusion rates within the T-2 phase have also been quantified and applied to the materials processing strategies. The materials design based on the phase stability, diffusion and defect structure analysis in the Mo-Si-B system can also be applied to the design of new multiphase high-temperature alloys with balanced environmental and mechanical properties.

abstract = {Four Mo/Mo5SiB2 in-situ composites with different volume fractions of Mo solid solution, V-f(Mo), were produced by ingot metallurgy and their microstructure, thermal expansion, compressive strength and oxidation behavior were investigated relating to V-f(Mo). Mo-8.5Si-13.2B annealed at 2073 K for 24 h has nearly eutectic microstructure consisting of Mo solid solution and Mo5SiB2. to For higher V-f(Mo), there are micro-cracks in Mo5SiB2, phase probably induced by thermal stress during the cooling process. Mo-8.5Si-13.2B shows the highest yield stress among the four Mo/Mo5SiB2 in-situ composites, and about 1 GPa even at 1773 K. For lower V-f(Mo) than that of Mo-8.5Si-13.2B, the steady state oxidation behavior is observed at temperatures between 1173 and 1473 K, indicating that the oxidation resistance is relatively good, whereas the oxidation resistance is catastrophic for higher V-f(Mo) than that of Mo-8.5Si-13.2B.

title = {High temperature strength of Mo-Mo3Si-Mo5SiB2 molybdenum silicides},
abstract = {Ternary and quaternary intermetallic alloys consisting of the phases Mo3Si, Mo5SiB2 ("T2") and alpha-Mo (Mo solid solution) were fabricated by melting and casting as well as powder-metallurgy (PM). A newly developed PM technique allowed the fabrication of microstructures with a nearly continuous alpha-Mo matrix. The creep strengths were determined by slow compression testing at an initial strain rate of 10(-5) s(-1) at temperatures ranging from 1200 to 140.6 degreesC. Alloying with niobium improved the creep strength much more than alloying with tungsten. This result is rationalized in terms of the atomic size difference between Mo and Nb. Not only the composition but also the topology and scale of the microstructure had a pronounced influence on the creep strength. As expected, coarse microstructures with isolated alpha-Mo particles resulted in higher creep strengths than microstructures with a continuous alpha-Mo matrix.

The compositional homogeneity range for T1 (Mo5Si3Bx) phase was determined to be much smaller than that reported previously by Nowotny. Compressive creep measurements show that materials based on the phase assemblage of T1-T2 (Mo5SiB2)-Mo3Si have high creep strengths similar to single phase Mo,Si,. Electrical resistivity of selected compositions was also measured and varied from approximate to 0.06 m Omega-cm at room temperature to 0.14 m Omega-cm at 1500 degrees C. Temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) was estimated to be on the order of 1 x 10(-4) C-1 for most compositions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

title = {Determination of the precipitation kinetics of Ni3Al in the Ni-Al system using differential scanning calorimetry},
abstract = {With the aim of establishing the kinetics of gamma' precipitation in the Ni-Al system, quantitative differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been used to determine the evolution of enthalpy at cooling rates of 5, 10 and 20 K min(-1) for alloys of nominal composition 13.0, 14.2, 15.8 and 18.5 at.\% Al. A theoretical model for the reaction has been constructed in order to deduce the reaction kinetics from the calorimetric data. It is assumed that the variation of enthalpy is governed by the changes in gamma' volume fraction and gamma' concentration with time and temperature; any contribution from the coarsening of gamma' is neglected. A thermodynamical description of the system is required, and an accurate assessment with respect to the generalised sublattice model has been employed. For modelling purposes a critical undercooling is needed and this has been estimated from the calorimetric data. A single nucleation event is assumed to occur within a spherical transformation volume, the radius of which is chosen to be consistent with experimental measurements made on the microstructures of the DSC samples. It is shown that the approach is able to reproduce the DSC curves with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The method has been used to estimate continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curves for these alloys. It is believed that these are the first reported measurements of the kinetics of the gamma' precipitation reaction in this system. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

title = {Ambient to high temperature fracture toughness and fatigue-crack propagation behavior in a Mo-12Si-8.5B (at.\%) intermetallic},
abstract = {Boron-containing molybdenum silicides have been the focus of significant research of late due to their potentially superior low-temperature "pest" resistance and high-temperature oxidation resistance comparable to that of MoSi2-based silicides; however, like many ordered intermetallics, they are plagued by poor ductility and toughness properties. Of the Various multiphase Mo-Si-B intermetallic systems available, alloys with compositions of Mo-12Si-8.5B (at.\%), which contain Mo, Mo3Si, and T2 phases. are anticipated to have higher toughnesses because of the presence of the relatively ductile Mo phase. In this study, we examine the ambient to high (1300 degreesC) temperature fracture toughness (R-curve) and fatigue-crack growth characteristics of Mo-12Si-8.5B. with the objective of discerning the salient mechanisms governing crack growth. It is found that this alloy displays a relatively high intrinsic (crack-initiation) toughness at 800 up to 1200 degreesC (similar to 10 MPa rootm), but only limited extrinsic R-curve (crack-growth) toughness. Although the lack of extrinsic toughening mechanisms is not necessarily beneficial to quasi-static properties, it does imply in a brittle material that it should show only minimal susceptibility to premature failure by fatigue, as is indeed observed at temperatures from ambient to 1300 degreesC. Of particular significance is that both the fracture toughness and the threshold stress intensity for fatigue are increased with increasing temperature over this range. This remarkable property is related to a variety of toughening mechanisms that become active at elevated temperatures, specifically involving crack trapping by the alpha -Mo phase and extensive microcracking primarily in the Mo5SiB2 phase.

abstract = {There is presently limited information regarding liquid-solid phase equilibria at the metal-rich region of the Nb-Cr-Si system; these data are needed for the development of the Nb-silicide based in situ composites. In the present study a range of metal-rich Nb-Cr-Si alloys with Si concentrations up to 30 at.\% was carefully selected using a phase diagram that was calculated from the prior developed thermodynamic description of the Nb-Cr-Si system. The as-cast microstructures were examined using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron probe microanalysis, and electron backscatter diffraction. A new ternary phase Nb-9(CrSi)(5), isostructural with the Nb9Co3Ge2 phase, was identified in the present study. Four primary solidification regions were identified in these alloys: (Nb), Nb-9(CrSi)(5), Nb5Si3, and Cr2Nb(C14). Microstructural and microchemical evidence suggests six invariant reactions on the liquidus surface of the metal-rich region of the Nb-Cr-Si system. At the Nb-rich side there are four invariant reactions: Liquid + Nb3Si -> Nb5Si3 + (Nb), Liquid + Nb5Si3 -> Nb-9(CrSi)(5) + (Nb), Liquid + Nb5Si3 -> Nb-9(Cr,Si)(5) + Cr2Nb(C-14), and Liquid Nb-9(Cr,Si)(5) + (Nb) + Cr2Nb(C14). At the Cr-rich side there are two invariant reactions: Liquid + Nb5Si3 -> Cr2Nb(C14) + Cr3Si and Liquid -> (Cr) + Cr2Nb(C14) + Cr3Si. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title = {Preparation of MoB and MoB-MoSi2 composites by combustion synthesis in SHS mode},
abstract = {Combustion synthesis in the mode of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) was carried out in the MO-B and Mo-B-Si systems for the preparation of molybdenum boride MOB and the composite of MoB-MoSi2 from elemental powder compacts. Under a preheating temperature above 150 degrees C, the reaction of Mo with boron in the sample compact of Mo:B =1:1 is characterized by a planar combustion front propagating in a self-sustaining and steady manner. As the preheating temperature or sample compaction density increased, combustion temperature was found to increase and the propagation rate of the combustion front was correspondingly enhanced. Moreover, the XRD analysis provides evidence of yielding nearly single-phase alpha-MoB from the Mo-B sample at equiatomic stoichiometry. In the synthesis of MoB-MoSi2 composites, the starting stoichiometry of the Mo-B-Si powder compact was varied so as to produce the final composites containing 20-80 mol\% MoB. It was also found the increase of flame-front velocity and combustion temperature with increasing MOB content formed in the composite. The composition analysis by XRD shows excellent conversion from the Mo-B-Si powder compact to the MoB-MoSi2 composite through the SHS reaction; that is, in addition to a small amount of Mo5Si3, the as-synthesized composite is composed entirely of MOB and MOSi2.

The solidification pathways as well as the width of the two-phase field at high temperature are modified by refractory metal substitutions. The characteristically severe solidification segregation found in Mo-B-Si alloys may be significantly reduced if the substitution such as Nb for Mo change the T-2-phase lattice constants to facilitate a larger compositional exchange between B and Si in the T-2 phase. The enhanced B and Si exchange also yields a significant increase in the width of Mo(ss) + T-2 two-phase field.

title = {Oxidation resistance coatings of Mo-Si-B alloys via a pack cementation process},
abstract = {Oxidation behavior of Si pack cementation coatings on a three-phase Mo-Si-B alloy was examined. During Si pack cementation of a three-phase Mo-Si-B alloy, a MOSi2 outer layer was synthesized on the exterior layer. Following oxidation in air of the pack-coated alloys at 1200 degrees C, the MoSi2 phase layer was consumed and replaced by the Mo5Si3 (or T-1) phase. The synthesized T-1 phase provided excellent oxidation resistance when exposed to high temperatures. The silicide-coated alloys exhibit higher oxidation resistance compared with uncoated Mo-Si-B alloys. The enhanced oxidation behavior and its mechanism are discussed in terms of the thicknesses of the oxide layers under exposure to high temperatures.},

title = {Liquidus projection for the Mo-rich portion of the Mo-Si-B ternary system},
abstract = {The solidification behavior in the Mo-rich portion of the Mo-Si-B ternary system has been examined based on the microstructures of are-cast alloys. Several solidification characteristics in the Mo-rich portion of the system have been identified using XRD, SEM and TEM. The liquidus projection in the Mo-rich portion includes six primary solidification reactions; five reactions originating from the Mo-Si and Mo-B binary sections (Mo, Mo2B, beta MoB, Mo3Si and Mo5Si3) and one from the ternary-based (Mo5SiB2) T-2 phase. The liquidus surface in general descends from the high melting temperature Mo-B binary side to the lower melting temperature Mo-Si binary side. The solidification path of alloys with compositions in the T-2 phase region is always preceded by the peritectic reaction of beta MoB + L-->T-2. In addition,four Class II reactions (four-phase reactions) and one Class I reaction (invariant ternary eutectic reaction) have been identified. The extent of solidification segregation in alloys with compositions in the Mo(ss)+ T-2 two-phase field is discussed as it pertains to materials processing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

title = {Deformation behavior of a two-phase Mo-Si-B alloy},
abstract = {Mo-Si-B alloys are being considered as possible candidates for high-temperature applications beyond the capabilities of Ni-based super-alloys. In this paper, the high-temperature (1000-1400 degrees C) compression response over a range of quasi-static strain rates, as well as the monotonic and cyclic crack growth behaviors (as a function of temperature from 20 degrees C to 1400 degrees C) of a two-phase Mo-Si-B alloy containing a Mo solid solution matrix (Mo(Si,B)) with similar to 38 vol\% of the T2 phase (Mo5SiB2) is discussed. Analysis of the compression results confirmed that deformation in the temperature-strain-rate space evaluated is matrix-dominated, yielding an activation energy of similar to 415-445 kJ/mol. Fracture toughness of the Mo-Si-B alloy varies from similar to 8 MPa root m at room temperature to similar to 25 MPa root m at 1400 degrees C, the increase in toughness with temperature being steepest between 1200 degrees C and 1400 degrees C. S-N response at room temperature is shallow whereas at 1200 degrees C, a definitive fatigue response is observed. Fatigue crack growth studies using R = 0.1 confirm the Paris slope for the two alloys to be high at room temperature (similar to 20-30) but decreases with increasing temperature to similar to 3 at 1400 degrees C. The crack growth rate (da/dN) for a fixed value of Delta K in the Paris regime in the 900-1400 degrees C range, increases with increasing temperature. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

title = {Monotonic and cyclic crack growth response of a Mo-Si-B alloy},
abstract = {Fracture toughness and fatigue response in the temperature range 20-1400 degrees C of a two-phase Mo-Si-B alloy is compared to that of a TZM alloy. Fracture toughness of the Mo-Si-B alloy varies from similar to 8 MPa root m at room temperature to similar to 25 MPa root m at 1400 degrees C, the increase in toughness with temperature being steepest between 1200 and 1400 degrees C. S-N response at room temperature is shallow whereas at 1200 degrees C, a definitive fatigue response is observed. Fatigue crack growth in vacuum and air in the temperature interval 20-600 degrees C is similar for the Mo-Si-B alloy whereas significant deterioration is noted for TZM when it is tested in air. The difference in response is attributed to differences in the oxide scales formed in the two alloys. The Paris slopes for the two alloys is high at room temperature (similar to 20-30) and decreases with increasing temperature to similar to 3 at 1400 degrees C. For the Mo-Si-B alloy, da/dN for a fixed value of Delta K in the Paris regime in the 900-1400 degrees C range, increases with increasing temperature. Apparent activation energies extracted using an Arrhenius-type relationship illustrate grain-boundary diffusion dominance in the 900-1200 degrees C regime and volume diffusion dominance ill the 12001400 degrees C regime.

title = {Physical and mechanical properties of single crystals of the T-2 phase in the Mo-Si-B system},
abstract = {The T-2 phase in the Mo-Si-B system is a refractory molybdenum borosilicide with great potential for ultra-high temperature structural applications. We recently succeeded in growing high purity single crystals of the T-2 phase with a composition of Mo-14Si-26B (at.\%) using an optical floating zone method. Electrical resistivity of the T-2 phase is isotropic with respect to the a and c axes and it monotonously increases with temperature from similar to 40 mu Omega cm at room temperature to similar to 80 mu Omega cm at 800 degreesC. The anisotropy ratio of thermal expansion coefficient (alpha (c)/alpha (a)) of the T2 phase is approximately 1.4 at 500 degreesC which is significantly smaller than 2.2 for Mo5Si3. The bulk, shear and Young's moduli and the Debye temperature of the T-2 phase are slightly higher than those of Mo5Si3. Slip on [001]{100} was observed on [021] oriented specimens both compressed and crept at 1500 degreesC. However, slip on < 100 > (001), which has been reported to be operative, was not observed. [001] dislocations are mostly straight and long, and tend to align along their edge orientation. The preference for slip on [001]{100} is interpreted on the basis of the crystal structure. The steady-state creep rate is low under the creep conditions. It is, for example, 3.1x10(-8) s(-1) at 1500 degreesC and 432 MPa. The activation energy and stress exponent for creep was found to be similar to 740 kJ/mol and 6.8, respectively. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Niobium-reinforced MoSi2 composites have shown a large improvement in fracture toughness over the MoSi2 matrix. However, the chemical incompatibility of niobium with MoSi2 has to be solved for high-temperature structural applications of the composite. In addition, the effects of interfacial coatings on the fracture toughness of ductile-phase-reinforced composites need to be investigated to find the optimum toughening effect of niobium reinforcement. In the present study different oxide coatings, Al2O3 and ZrO2, were applied to niobium reinforcement and effectiveness of the coatings as diffusion barriers was evaluated. The mechanical behavior and the fractographic characteristics of constrained niobium were also examined. Finally, the effect of the coatings on fracture toughness of the composites was studied and compared with predictions based upon tensile tests on a single constrained niobium reinforcement. The results are discussed in terms of the interfacial fracture energy and micromechanical models of ductile-phase-reinforced composites.},

On the basis of creep strength, ultimate tensile strength and oxidation resistance, seven intermetallic compounds with melting temperatures above 1600 C have been selected as possible candidate materials for high temperature structural applications in advanced aero-turbines. These compounds, Nb3Al, Cr3Si, Co2Nb, Cr2Nb, MoSi2, Mo5Si3 and Nb2Al, have been evaluated and their properties reported. All seven of the compounds displayed excellent creep resistance at 1200 C with Mo5Si3 and Nb2Al being the strongest. Nb3Al, with the precipitation of the niobium solid solution, displayed the greatest low temperature toughness. The greatest ultimate tensile strengths were observed for Co2Nb and MoSi2, while MoSi2 was by far the most oxidation resistant. (Author)

In order to achieve this goal for Mo-based alloys the fundamental concepts of reactive diffusion pathway analysis and kinetic biasing are used to design a multilayer coating with a phase sequencing that provides for structural and thermodynamic compatibility and an underlying diffusion barrier to maintain coating integrity. The coating structure evolution during high-temperature exposure facilitates a prolonged lifetime as well as a self-healing capability. Both borosilicide and aluminide coatings that can be synthesized by a pack cementation process are demonstrated to yield superior environmental resistance on Mo-based systems at temperatures up to l,700A degrees C and can be adapted to apply to other refractory metal systems.},

abstract = {Crack growth behavior during monotonic and cyclic loading at elevated temperature is affected by creep and/or by environment and, therefore, high-temperature toughness and fatigue response can be temperature and loading-rate dependent. This paper reports on the effect of loading rate on fracture toughness at high temperatures for a two-phase Nlo-Si-B alloy; the observed response is understood by examining the interaction of the advancing crack with the microstructure, and the evolution of microstructure ahead of the crack tip as a consequence of the crack-tip field. Parallel studies were also performed under cyclic loading conditions by subjecting compact tension specimens to sinusoidal and trapezoidal loading waveforms. In certain cases, the microstructure ahead of the crack tip revealed several instabilities (recrystallization, grain growth and creep cavitation). Finite element analysis revealed strain localization 'pockets' ahead of the crack tip, which are thought to provide the driving force for the observed microstructural instabilities.

abstract = {Nb3Co3CrSi6 (isostructural to Nb3Fe3CrSi6) and Nb4Co4Si7 (isostructural to Zr4CO4Ge7) intermetallic compounds have been studied from the oxidation point of view. Isothermal oxidation results at 1300 degrees C are discussed. The volatilisation of the external chromia layer formed by oxidation on Nb3Co3CrSi6 was quantified by analysing the thermogravimetric curves on the basis of the differential equation that describes the oxidation kinetics. Nb4Co4Si7 is a typical SiO2-forming compound with a parabolic oxidation constant k(p)' = 6 x 10(-13) g(2)/cm(4) s. Nb3Co3CrSi6 oxidises by formation of a duplex SiO2-Cr2O3 layer but is mainly a Cr2O3-forming compound with k(p)' = 1.8 x 10(-11) g(2)/cm(4) s and the linear volatilisation constant k(1)' = 1.85 x 10(-9) g/cm(2) s. Transformation of Nb3Co3CrSi6 into Nb4Co4Si7 slows down the diffusion of Cr towards the surface leading to an overall decreasing of the Cr2O3 formation rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

title = {APPRAISAL OF OTHER SILICIDES AS STRUCTURAL-MATERIALS},
abstract = {With the recognition of oxidation-resistant MoSi2 as the ideal matrix material for high temperature structural composites, there has been a growing interest in "other" silicides. This paper is an attempt to place such interest in proper perspective with a comprehensive review of recent activities. The "other" silicides are appraised in terms of diverse strategies for the development of structural materials, which may be broadly grouped as monolithic, in situ composites and artificially reinforced composites. With alloying as an underlying common theme, it is argued that a broader and a more fundamental understanding of the silicides is necessary. The formation of silicides is reviewed with the focus on the disilicides, 5-3 silicides and monosilicides, as the three principal useful groups. For the refractory metal based disilicides, the relationship between the crystal structures C11b, C40, C49 and C54 is examined in terms of stacking sequences and contrasted in relation to the structures of aluminides. The role of interstitial elements and the in situ composite approaches are emphasized for the complex 5-3 silicides and the monosilicides as being the most adjacent phases to refractory metal solid solutions. For most silicides with a non-cubic crystal structure, the effect of associated anisotropy of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) on the mechanical integrity through processing and application of the material, is brought forth as a potentially critical issue. A qualitative model is proposed to rationalize the pronounced occurrence of "pest" disintegration in terms of the anisotropy of CTE, the natur, of the grain structure and the ductile-brittle transition temperature of intermetallics.},

In this study, electron backscatter diffraction in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy is applied to measure the plastic strain imposed to stainless steel by tensile load. A new parameter, which quantifies the spread of the crystal orientation within individual grains arising due to dislocation accumulation during plastic deformation, is correlated with imposed plastic strain. The new parameter is called 'crystal deformation' and is determined from the spread in misorientation from the central grain orientation. It is confirmed that this parameter has a good correlation with plastic strain and is not affected by the data density of the crystal orientation map. The dislocation density distribution is also evaluated from the misorientation from the central orientation. Relatively high dislocation density was observed near grain boundaries and grain boundary triple points, which was consistent with the observed deterioration of EBSD pattern quality in those locations.

title = {Eutectic colony formation: A stability analysis},
abstract = {Experiments have widely shown that a steady-stare lamellar eutectic solidification front is destabilized on a scale much larger than the lamellar spacing by the rejection of a dilute ternary impurity and forms two-phase cells commonly referred to as "eutectic colonies." We extend the stability analysis of Datye and Langer [V. Datye and J. S. Langer, Phys. Rev. B 24, 4155 (1981)] for a binary eutectic to include the effect of a ternary impurity. We find that the expressions for the critical onset velocity and morphological instability wavelength are analogous to those for the classic Mullins-Sekerka;a instability of a monophase planar interface, albeit with an effective surface tension that depends on the geometry of the lamellar interface and, nontrivially, on interlamellar diffusion. A qualitatively new aspect of this instability is the occurrence of oscillatory modes due to the interplay between the destabilizing effect of the ternary impurity and the dynamical feedback of the local change in lamellar spacing on the front motion. Ina transient regime, these modes lead to the formation of large scale oscillatory microstructures for which there is recent experimental evidence in a transparent organic system. Moreover, it is shown that the eutectic front dynamics on a scale larger than the lamellar spacing can be formulated as an effective monophase interface free boundary problem with a modified Gibbs-Thomson condition that is coupled to a slow evolution equation for the lamellar spacing. This formulation provides additional physical insights into the nature of the instability and a simple means to calculate an approximate stability spectrum. Finally, we investigate the influence of the ternary impurity on a short wavelength oscillatory instability that is already present at off-eutectic compositions in binary eutectics.

The results show that the Zr addition leads to coarseness of primary Nbss phase promotes formation and coarseness of Nbss and gamma(Nb)(5)Si-3 lamellar eutectic structure. In addition, the Zr addition increases the hardness of Nbss and (Nb)(3)Si phases. The yield strength at room temperature of the alloys improves with increasing Zr content. The fracture strain reaches a peak value in 3 at.\% Zr content, and then drops with the increase of Zr content. The high temperature strength decreases first and reaches a minimal value in 3 at.\% Zr content, and then increases again. These variations are attributed to the microstructure and composition changes of the alloys with increasing Zr content. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title = {Non-contact measurement of creep resistance of ultra-high-temperature materials},
abstract = {Continuing pressures for higher performance and efficiency in energy conversion and propulsion systems are driving ever more demanding needs for new materials which can survive high stresses at the elevated temperatures. In such severe environments, the characterization of creep properties becomes indispensable. Conventional techniques for the measurement of creep are limited to about 1700 degrees C. A new method which can be applied at temperatures higher than 2000 degrees C is strongly demanded. This paper presents a non-contact method for creep measurements of ultra-high-temperature materials at 2300 degrees C. Using the electrostatic levitation facility at NASA MSFC, a spherical sample was rotated quickly enough to cause creep deformation due to centripetal acceleration. The deformation of the sample was captured with a digital camera, and the images were analyzed to measure creep deformation. To validate experimental results, numerical and analytical analyses on creep deformation of a rotating sphere have been conducted. The experimental, numerical, and analytical results showed good agreement with one another. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

title = {Annealing response of point defects in off-stoichiometric Mo5SiB2 phase},
abstract = {Dislocations and planar faults are found to develop in the Mo5SiB2 phase during elevated temperature annealing. The dislocations formed in Mo5SiB2 of annealed alloys are mostly edge dislocations with the Burgers vectors of < 100], 1/2 < 111], and < 110]. For the Mo-rich Mo5SiB2 phase that formed in a Mo-10Si-20B alloy, a significant amount of constitutional vacancies is introduced during solidification, and the excess vacancies aggregate and collapse into dislocations. At the same time, these dislocations can act as the heterogeneous nucleation sites for the subsequent Mo precipitation. For the Mo-lean Mo5SiB2 phase that formed in a Mo-13Si-28B alloy, the constitutional defects are not significant for the development of dislocations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title = {AN EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF CR3SI ALLOYED WITH MO},
abstract = {The properties of a Cr3Si alloy designed for the high temperature, high velocity gas dow conditions typical of the operating environment within an aircraft engine are discussed. The alloy composition was obtained by macroalloying Cr3Si with Mo to improve its high temperature oxidation resistance. Detailed cyclic, isothermal and low temperature ''pest'' oxidation studies conducted between 773 and 1673 K revealed that the alloy has excellent oxidation properties due to the formation of dual protective oxides scales of Cr2O3 at low temperatures and SiO2 at high temperatures. Preliminary burner rig tests conducted at 1473 K in a 0.3 mach combustion flame indicated that the alloy life is expected to exceed 100 cycles. The alloy exhibits a compressive brittle-to-ductile transition temperature of about 1500 K. The compression strengths vary between 650 MPa at 1500 K and 50 MPa at 1700 K. Preliminary results suggest that the compressive creep strength of the as-cast alloy is equal to or better than MoSi2-reinforced with either SiCp or SiCw, while that of the powder metallurgically-processed alloy is comparable only to the unreinforced MoSi2. The room temperature fracture toughness of the alloy was determined to be between 2.0 and 3.0 MPa m1/2.},

title = {Effect of microstructure on the high-temperature deformation behavior of Nb-Si alloys},
abstract = {Deformation behavior of Nb-Si-Zr alloys is investigated at various temperatures ranging from R.T. to 1670 K. The master alloy ingots composed of Nb-18.1 at\% Si-1.5 at\%\ Zr doped with Mg are Ar-arc-melted. The ingots contain Nb rods (radius: 1 mu m) in Nb3Si matrix formed by eutectic reaction. Alloys are subjected to heat treatments at 1923 K for 4-100 h to obtain a large Nb network structure with small silicide (alpha-Nb5Si3) particles by decomposing Nb3Si matrix into Nb and Nb5Si3 through a eutectoid reaction. Compression tests are conducted at room temperature in air and at elevated temperatures in Ar atmosphere. At 1471 K the maximum strength is 500 MPa and compressive ductility is higher than 10\% with a strain rate of 1.0 x 10(-4) s(-1), while at room temperature the maximum strength is over 1500 MPa and compressive ductility is about 1.5\%. The high-temperature deformation obeys a power-law type equation. The stress exponent n is evaluated to be 4.8 and the apparent activation energy is 350kJ/mol. The Vickers indentation at room temperature revealed that the crack propagation at room temperature is suppressed effectively by ductile Nb. This suggests that the Nb aggregate in the network structure acts as a large Nb grain containing fine Nb5Si3 particles, which might be beneficial for ductility at low temperatures.
