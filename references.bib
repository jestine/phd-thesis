	Abstract = {Multiphase Mo-Si-B alloys containing a Mo solid solution matrix and brittle Mo3Si and Mo5SiB2 (T2) intermetallic phases are candidates for ultra-high-temperature applications. The elevated temperature uniaxial tensile response at a nominal strain rate of 10(-4) s(-1) and the tensile creep response at constant load between 1000 degrees C and 1300 degrees C of a (i) single phase solid solution (Mo-3.0Si-1.3B in at.\%), (ii) two-phase alloy containing similar to 35 vol.\% T2 phase (Mo-6Si-8B in at.\%) and (iii) three-phase alloy with similar to 50 vol.\% T2 + Mo3Si phases (Mo-8.6Si-8.7B in at.\%) were evaluated. The results confirm that Si in solid solution significantly enhances both the yield strength and the creep resistance of these materials. A Larson-Miller plot of the creep data showed improved creep resistance of the two- and three-phase alloys in comparison with Ni-based superalloys. The extent of Si dissolved in the solid solution phase varied in these three alloys and Si appeared to segregate to dislocations and grain boundaries. A stress exponent of similar to 5 for the solid solution alloy and similar to 7 at 1200 degrees C for the two multiphase alloys suggested dislocation climb to be the controlling mechanism. Grain boundary precipitation of the T2 phase during creep deformation was observed and the precipitation kinetics appear to be affected by the test temperature and applied stress.

	Abstract = {Fracture toughness and fatigue response in the temperature range 20-1400 degrees C of a two-phase Mo-Si-B alloy is compared to that of a TZM alloy. Fracture toughness of the Mo-Si-B alloy varies from similar to 8 MPa root m at room temperature to similar to 25 MPa root m at 1400 degrees C, the increase in toughness with temperature being steepest between 1200 and 1400 degrees C. S-N response at room temperature is shallow whereas at 1200 degrees C, a definitive fatigue response is observed. Fatigue crack growth in vacuum and air in the temperature interval 20-600 degrees C is similar for the Mo-Si-B alloy whereas significant deterioration is noted for TZM when it is tested in air. The difference in response is attributed to differences in the oxide scales formed in the two alloys. The Paris slopes for the two alloys is high at room temperature (similar to 20-30) and decreases with increasing temperature to similar to 3 at 1400 degrees C. For the Mo-Si-B alloy, da/dN for a fixed value of Delta K in the Paris regime in the 900-1400 degrees C range, increases with increasing temperature. Apparent activation energies extracted using an Arrhenius-type relationship illustrate grain-boundary diffusion dominance in the 900-1200 degrees C regime and volume diffusion dominance ill the 12001400 degrees C regime.

	Abstract = {Crack growth behavior during monotonic and cyclic loading at elevated temperature is affected by creep and/or by environment and, therefore, high-temperature toughness and fatigue response can be temperature and loading-rate dependent. This paper reports on the effect of loading rate on fracture toughness at high temperatures for a two-phase Mo-Si-B alloy; the observed response is understood by examining the interaction of the advancing crack with the microstructure, and the evolution of microstructure ahead of the crack tip as a consequence of the crack-tip field. Parallel studies were also performed under cyclic loading conditions by subjecting compact tension specimens to sinusoidal and trapezoidal loading waveforms. In certain cases, the microstructure ahead of the crack tip revealed several instabilities (recrystallization, grain growth and creep cavitation). Finite element analysis revealed strain localization 'pockets' ahead of the crack tip, which are thought to provide the driving force for the observed microstructural instabilities.
